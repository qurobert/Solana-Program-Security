# Solana-Program-Security
Issues and how to fix them in this insecure program: https://github.com/GitBolt/insecure-program

##1. Missing Signer Validation
###Issue: The sender's authorization via signature is not verified.
###Where: In transfer_points method.
###Patch:
if !sender.to_account_info().is_signer {
    return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}

##2. Integer Overflow or Underflow
###Issue: Points are manipulated without safeguards against overflow or underflow.
###Where: Operations on sender.points and receiver.points in transfer_points.
###Patch:
sender.points = sender.points.checked_sub(amount).ok_or(ProgramError::InvalidArgument)?;
receiver.points = receiver.points.checked_add(amount).ok_or(ProgramError::InvalidArgument)?;

##3. Sender and Receiver Identity Check
###Issue: The program does not prevent the sender from transferring points to themselves.
###Where: In transfer_points method.
###Patch:
if sender.key() == receiver.key() {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}

##4. Missing Ownership Verification
###Issue: The ownership of the accounts (sender and receiver) is not verified.
###Where: In transfer_points method.
###Patch:
if sender.to_account_info().owner != program_id || receiver.to_account_info().owner != program_id {
    return Err(ProgramError::IllegalOwner);
}

##5. Insecure Initialization of User Points
###Issue: New users are initialized with a fixed number of points without safeguards or conditions.
###Where: In initialize method.
###Patch:
Consider introducing conditions or configurations for points allocation.

##6. Lack of Authorization in User Removal
###Issue: There's no verification that the caller is authorized to remove a user.
###Where: In remove_user method.
###Patch:
if !signer.to_account_info().is_signer {
    return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}
